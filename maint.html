    DodoCodes.com is down and may be unavailable for several hours (hopefully not!).
    <br />
    The datacenter that DodoCodes.com is hosted in is having issues and needs to replace power to the unit.
    <br />
    I am waiting for an update from their technical team. The website and mobile app will be unavailable until the power
    is restored to the server.
    <br />
    I wish I had better news but at this time it's completely out of my control. We're playing the waiting game.
    <br /><br />
    Thank you for your patience
    <br>
